    <p class="first-Text">THE METHODIST’S STORY</p>
    <h1 class="we">WE STAND FOR LIVES CHANGED BY CHRIST</h1>
    <p class="paragraph">
        Our Church started with a small group of people who used to congregate in a small 
        living room in Rotterdam South. Today they're over 500. They posed inquiries such as,
        "Imagine a church that prioritizes others." This mindset centered on serving others
        has not only influenced our identity but also continues to shape us. As we embarked on
        establishing new branches and reaching various communities across Rotterdam, our mission
        has remained unwavering. Today, Methodist Church Rotterdam stands as a single church with
        multiple sites spread throughout Rotterdam. Each location offers a consistent, 
        cohesive experience with music and a shared message delivered by a communicator 
        that is broadcasted to every site.
